# 1. Sequence and it's operation

## What is Sequences

A sequence is a succession of values bound together by a container that reflects their type. In other words, Sequences are containers with the items or elements that are accessible by indexing or slicing.

Almost every stream that you put in Python is a sequence. The sequence is central to programming and central to Python.

### Type of Sequence
    - 1. List
    - 2. Tuples
    - 3. Xrange
    - 4. Strings
    - 5. Sets
    - 6. Dictionaries
